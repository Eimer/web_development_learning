          <p>The most important component of the spiritual

            implementation of the process of knowledge dissemination.
            It covers the activities of social institutions that prepare
            young people for life. Higher education for young people -
            this is the foundation on which they should build their future
            and the future of their country. This is due to the fact that
            higher education provides a broad-minded man and erudition.
            Moral values of people, society and manner of behavior in it
            all these develop thanks to knowledge obtained at the
            university.

          <h2>Gaming:</h2>
          <p>Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be
            played alone,
            in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such
            as when people
            are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their
            own audience
            as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding
            who is part of
            their audience and who is a player.

          <h2  class="to_hide">Coloring books:</h2>
          <p  class="to_hide">Paint books and coloring books emerged in the United States as part of the "democratization of art"
            process, inspired by
            a series of lectures by British artist Joshua Reynolds, and the works of Swiss educator Johann Heinrich
            Pestalozzi and his
            student Friedrich Fröbel. Many educators concluded that all, regardless of background, students stood to
            benefit from art
            education as a means of enhancing their conceptual understanding of the tangible, developing their cognitive
            abilities, and
            improving skills that would be useful in finding a profession, as well as for the children's spiritual
            edification. The McLoughlin
            Brothers are credited as the inventors of the coloring book, when, in the 1880s, they produced The Little
            Folks' Painting Book,
            in collaboration with Kate Greenaway. They continued to publish coloring books until the 1920s, when the
            McLoughlin Brothers became
            part of the Milton Bradley Company.

          <h2 class="to_hide">Winemaking:</h2>
          <p class="to_hide">Winemaking or vinification is the production of wine, starting with the selection of the fruit, its
            fermentation into alcohol, and
            the bottling of the finished liquid. The history of wine-making stretches over millennia. The science of
            wine and winemaking is known
            as oenology. A winemaker may also be called a vintner. The growing of grapes is viticulture and there are
            many varieties of grapes.

        <div class="list_content_four">
          <p>I began my career in retail management, but a few years ago, I was drawn to the healthcare space. I’ve
            always been skilled at bringing
            people together and working towards common goals. My experience successfully leading teams and managing
            stores led me to consider administration,
            and I’ve been building a career as a driven health administrator for the last four years.
          </p>
          <p>In my current role at XYZ Medical Center, the efficiency of the office has been a personal focus—especially
            as it relates to patient outcomes.
            I set and oversee goals related to department budget and patient volume. Last year, I worked with our IT
            department to implement a communication system
            for scheduling procedures and protocols to ensure that all departments were adequately staffed at all times.
            With our new online scheduling portal, we
            increased communication efficiency by 20%. To stay informed about their ongoing concerns, I hold regular
            meetings with physicians, nurses and other healthcare
            staff. In my role, I also manage marketing and advertising efforts on behalf of the Center. I’ve been really
            enjoying that part of my work and I’m especially
            interested in bringing the experience I’ve gained as well as my commitment to efficiency to the team at ABC
            Health. Outside of the office, I’m an avid reader
            and I love to hike. On weekends, you might find me at the local bookstore or exploring hiking trails in the
            area.
          </p>
          <p  class="to_hide">I graduated with a Business degree in 2010, and was offered an account management position from a
            telecommunications company I had interned with. I loved working
            with customers and managing and growing my accounts, but the industry we were in just wasn’t very appealing
            to me. After that, I stayed a full year and learned a ton
            about how to build and manage accounts successfully and I ended up becoming a top performer in my group
            before leaving. I left at the 1-year-mark to pursue a very
            similar position within an industry I’m much more excited about- healthcare. I’ve been at this healthcare
            startup space for 2 years with this company and I feel ready
            to take my career to the next level so that’s why I’m currently looking for a new opportunity.
