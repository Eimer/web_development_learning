	<h2>Superhero trivia</h2>
	<p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do
		them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a
		superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power
			a normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to use that power to
		accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be
		considered a superhero.
	</p>
	<p>For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular
		police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a
		good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a
		superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human
		being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.

	<p>Naruto is a boisterous and exuberant boy. He would end sentences with
		"Dattebayo!" (だってばよ!) when excited or frustrated. He has a number of
		childish traits, such as being a very picky eater (he almost exclusively
		eats ramen), being afraid of ghosts, and carries a chubby green-frog
		wallet which he calls "Gama-chan". Naruto is heedless to formality or
		social standings and has a habit of giving people he meets nicknames or
		addressing them without appropriate honourifics, as shown when he opted
		to call the Second Hokage a name he thought of off the top of his head
		instead of simply "Lord Second" (二代目様, Nidaime-sama).
