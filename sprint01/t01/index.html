			<td>The Soul Stone was one of the six Infinity Stones,
				the remnant of a singularity that predates the universe.
				For some time, it was kept on the planet Vormir under the
				watchful eye of the Red Skull, before Thanos came to the planet
				in search of it and had to tragically sacrifice his beloved daughter
				Gamora to obtain it.

			<td>Green</td>
			<td>The Time Stone was one of the six Infinity Stones,
				the remnants of singularities that predated the universe.
				It had the ability to manipulate time, even in places "beyond"
				time, such as the Dark Dimension. It was contained inside the
				Eye of Agamotto under the protection of the Masters of the Mystic
				Arts, who swore to protect it. Doctor Strange came across the relic
				in Wong's library and used it to force a bargain with Dormammu.

			<td>Space</td>
			<td>Blue</td>
			<td>The Space Stone was one of the six Infinity Stones, the remnant of
				a singularity that predated the universe, which represented the element
				of space. Housed within the Tesseract, over the course of history it
				was wielded by many individuals, including Johann Schmidt of HYDRA,
				Mar-Vell of the Kree Empire, the Skrulls, and Loki of Asgard. During
				the Infinity War, the Tesseract was shattered by Thanos, who put the
				Space Stone inside his Infinity Gauntlet. After Thanos successfully
				wiped out half of life, he destroyed the Space Stone, along with the other
				Infinity Stones to prevent his work being undone.

			<td>Mind</td>
			<td>Yellow</td>
			<td>The Mind Stone was one of the six Infinity Stones, the remnant of a
				singularity that predated the universe, which governed over the fabric
				of mind. It was previously wielded by Loki inside his Scepter who received
				it as a gift from Thanos for the Chitauri Invasion. After the Battle of New York,
				the Scepter was confiscated by HYDRA, whose scientists used it to give
				extraordinary powers to the twins Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. After the fall of
				HYDRA, the Scepter was recovered by the Avengers. It was taken by Ultron and its
				blue gem casing was shattered, releasing the stone inside it and placing it on the
				being that would become Vision.

			<td>Reality</td>
			<td>Red</td>
			<td>The Reality Stone was one of the six Infinity Stones, the remnant of a
				singularity that predated the universe, which represented the fabric of reality.
				Liquefied into a dark red fluid called the Aether (pronounced ēTHər),
				the Dark Elves and their leader Malekith intended to use it to bring eternal
				darkness upon all of the Nine Realms. Taken from the Elves by the Asgardians,
				it was later entrusted to the Collector following the conclusion of the Second Dark Elf Conflict.

			<td>Power</td>
			<td>Purpule</td>
			<td>The Power Stone was one of the six Infinity Stones, the remnant of a singularity
				that predated the universe. The Power Stone was a powerful weapon capable of granting
				a person with great, cosmic power, but was highly likely to kill any organic beings that touch it.
				It was used by Eson the Searcher until it was hidden for millennia on the planet Morag inside the Orb.
